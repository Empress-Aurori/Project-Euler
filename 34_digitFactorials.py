# Digit Factorials
# Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

# starting at 10?
# get number and save digits
# find the factorial of each digit
# check whether the sum of the factorial of the digits is equal to the number the digits were taken from

# how do you know when to stop checking for equality?
# will there be a point where the conditional will always be false?
# if there exists a very large number that proves the condition true how will I know it exists if the conditional keeps outputting false for some time?
# should I just create an arbitrary limit and keep raising it whenever I get the question wrong?
